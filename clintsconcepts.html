							<h2>Clint's Concepts</h2>
							<p>On this page, I'll be posting the most recent topics of discussion in the world of writing. All the articles will be stored under the archives page found in the menu at the top right corner of the screen!</p><br/>
							<h3>The Process of Writing</h3><br/>
							<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left">Ever since I published my first book, The Last Descendant: The Air Runes©, I've had a lot of  people ask me questions regarding my writing and how I went about writing a book. Since this has been a popular topic of conversation, I think it'd be a good idea to talk about what goes into writing a book.</p>
							<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left"><b>How long did it take?</b></br>This really depends on the book being written and what kind of research needs to be put into it. My book was purely a creative work, so I didn't have to spend any time on research. I was able to stay committed to writing every day. It took me about four months to write the first draft of my manuscript, but, as any author will tell you, there's a lot more that goes into a book than that. After the first four months, I spent another month editing and finishing up my final draft, and then one more month to prepare for the launch of the book. In total, I spent about six months preparing my book for its publication.</p>
							<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left"><b>Did you create an outline for the plot?</b></br>There will probably be plenty of authors and writers who cringe when they read this, but no. I had a vague sense of the direction that I wanted the book to go, but I never sat down and made an outline for the plot for the simple reason that I don't like rigidity to be a part of my writing. Writing is a form of art and sometimes it's better to let the expression flow through you onto the paper.</p>
							<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left"><b>Where did you get the inspiration for this book?</b></br>It's my firm belief that any fantasy book is going to draw some sort of inspiration from The Lord of the Rings. That book series was so iconic and revolutionary that any other book in that genre will inevitably be compared to it, kind of like any great basketball player will be compared to Michael Jordan. With that being said, some other honorable mentions would be Eragon, Harry Potter, and The Legend of Zelda.</p>
							<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left"><b>How did you find the time to read while writing?</b></br>Reading is just as important, if not more so, as writing is. I viewed reading other books as a kind of free tutoring lesson. Reading can expose you to new diction, grammar techniques, styles of writing, and techniques of advancing through a story. So, to answer the question, I simply made time for reading because I knew it was necessary.</p>
							<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left"><b>Were the characters in your book based off of anyone in your life?</b></br>Truthfully, no they were not. The only reflection that my book has from my own life is that Cail's relationship with his father is very similar to the relationship I have with mine. In the beginning of the book, Cecil, Cail's father, has certain expectations of his son. However, as the story develops, Cecil acknowledges that Cail is a different person, and Cecil accepts that, allowing their relationship to flourish.</p>
							<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left">That is a summary of some of the many questions that people have asked me since the release of the book. I hope this has served as a good look into the process of writing a book. If you haven't picked up a copy of the book yet, just click the link below and get it today!</p>
